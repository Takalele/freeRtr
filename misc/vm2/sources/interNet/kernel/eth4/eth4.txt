block pipeline should opened for this process...
the client has to send one of the command packets...
this process replies to it, and closes the connection...
the commands and replies are the following:
command                          reply
'arpadd--' ipv4 ethernet         'ok'
'arpread-' dd:sequence#          'arpdata' dd:max ipv4 ethernet
'data----'                       'data'
'param---'                       'param' dd: localIP, dd:gateIP, dd:netmask, [dd:DNSes]
if data mode accepted, the following protocol applies:
when client sends a packet, it will be sent over the ethernet...
if an ethernet packet received for ipv4, it will be sent over
the pipeline...
the packets has the following structure:
dd: ipv4 address...
db: data...
