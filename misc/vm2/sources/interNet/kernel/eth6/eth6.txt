block pipeline should opened for this process...
the client has to send one of the command packets...
this process replies to it, and closes the connection...
the commands and replies are the following:
command                          reply
'adradd--' ipv6 ethernet         'ok'
'adrread-' dd:sequence#          'adrdata' dd:max ipv6 ethernet
'data6---'                       'data6'
'param6--'                       'param6' db:srcTyp, db:trgTyp, db:phySize, ??:phyAddr, 16:linkIP, 16:localIP, 16:gateIP, 16:netmask, [16:DNSes]
if data mode accepted, the following protocol applies:
when client sends a packet, it will be sent over the ethernet...
if an ethernet packet received for ipv6, it will be sent over
the pipeline... in these cases, the data packet is used...
when

the packets has the following structure:
dd: type of packet: 0=data, 1=queryAddr, 2=cacheUpdate
16: ipv6 address...
db: data...
