block mode pipeline should be opened for this process...
once the pipeline is estabilished, the commands are
processed, and replies are generated by this process.
the sequence of received queries and sent responses
could differ! that the replies could arrive in any order!
the commands use the following format:
dd: type of query: 1=name-->addr, 2=addr-->name, 3=name-->mailer
string: mailer: domain name
        name-->addr: the address; without size byte!
        addr-->name: domain name
the responses use the following format:
dd: type of query: $80-status: 0=ok, else error, $7f=original type...
string: domain name
string: mailer: name#0+name#0...
        name-->addr: the address; without size byte!
        addr-->name: the address; without size byte!
