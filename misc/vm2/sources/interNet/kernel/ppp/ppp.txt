this process acts as an ethernet process except that this
operates over hdlc lines... when data mode chosen, this process
will relay any packet received from the upper level to the
peer, and any packet received from the peer, will be relayed
to the upper level... but there is no arp over the hdlc (since
this is a virtual circuit;) so arp requests are not supported,
dummy data returned for them...
another exception from other processes that this process
sends SignDaemoning sequence at least twice... first, when
the connection with lower level is estabilished, second, when
the peer has successfully configured, and ip addresses are
valid and available... (if future reconfiguration is done,
then another sequences are sent;) after every sequence, a
textural dump is done about all the current parameters...
