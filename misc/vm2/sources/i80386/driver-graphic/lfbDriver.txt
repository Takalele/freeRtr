block mode pipeline should be opened for video drivers...
after the pipeline is opened, the video driver sends
a packet, containing x and y resolution (each a dword)..
after it, the client is ready to pass screen data to
the driver... each packet begins with x and y coordiates
(each a dword).. this is the point, where writing will
begin. the remaining bytes are byte triplets. they make
up the video data in (db:red,green,blue format). they will
be displaied at the specified location.
