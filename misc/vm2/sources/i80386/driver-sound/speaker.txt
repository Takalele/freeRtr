block mode pipeline should be opened for this process...
when the pipeline is estabilished, the caller can send
packets over the line. each packet has the following
format:
frequency:dword  (0..1193180 in HZ)
duartion:dword   (0..60000 in MS)
note that 1000 microsecond = 1 second.
this process serializes incoming notes, and plays
them continously... zero frequency means silence...
