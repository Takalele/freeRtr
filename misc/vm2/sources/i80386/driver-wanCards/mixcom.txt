this process acts as an ethernet driver except that this
operates over x21 line... once a packet received, it
will transmitted, as ethernet.. but the frame format is
a bit different:
db: address
db: control
dw: protocol
??: payload
it's not significant, since ethernet has it's own frame
format, but good to know that this process does NOT change
the data, and passes everything found in hdlc frame...
