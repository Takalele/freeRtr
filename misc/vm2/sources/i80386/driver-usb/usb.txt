block mode pipeline must be opened for this process...
once the pipeline is estabilished, the following protocol
applies to the connection: each packet is prefixed with
a command dword, which is immediately followed by the data.
each command which was executed is acknowledged by the command
dword, and returned data, if any...
commands are the following:

00 - read number of ports...
      in: nothing...
     out: dword-number of ports...

01 - read frame counter...
      in: nothing...
     out: dword-current frame...

02 - enable port...
      in: dword-port number...
     out: nothing...

03 - disable port...
      in: dword-port number...
     out: nothing...

04 - get port status...
      in: dword-port number...
     out: dword-status: bit0-connected, bit1-enabled...
          dword-speed: 0=low, 1=high...

05 - send one packet...
      in: dword-device number...
          dword-endpoint number (inside of device)...
          dword-type: 0=output, 1=setup, 2=isochronous...
          dword-speed: 0=low, 1=high...
          dword-data toggle bit...
           byte-data to send...
     out: dword-status: 0=ok, 1=stalled, 2=buffer, 3=babble, 4=nak, 5=crc, 6=bitstuff, 7=piderror, 8=timeout...

06 - receive one packet...
      in: dword-bytes to receive...
          dword-device number...
          dword-endpoint number (inside of device)...
          dword-type: 0=input, 1=isochronous...
          dword-speed: 0=low, 1=high...
          dword-data toggle bit...
     out: dword-status: 0=ok, 1=stalled, 2=buffer, 3=babble, 4=nak, 5=crc, 6=bitstuff, 7=piderror, 8=timeout...
           byte-data received...
