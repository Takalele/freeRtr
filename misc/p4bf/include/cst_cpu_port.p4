/*
   Tofino1:

   The Physical port ID of the CPU PCIe port depends on the number of
   pipes (the Tofino ASIC comes in 2- and 4-pipe variants). Note that
   the CPU Eth port can't be used as interface to the control-plane on
   all platforms because it is not always wired to the main board. For
   example, on the WEDGE100BF-65X it is exposed as a port on the front
   panel. On the WEDGE100BF-32X, only two of the lanes are wired to
   the main boards (the others are not connected). Other platforms may
   use different setups.

   Tofino2:

   The documentation about CPU and recirculation ports is not yet
   available to us. We currently believe that the CPU PCIe port is
   always device port 0, i.e. attached to the (logical) pipe #0.

   In general, the "special" ports (i.e. CPU PCie, CPU Eth and
   recirculation) are always ports 0-7 on every pipe. We know for sure
   that on the BFN-T20-128Q, port 0 is the CPU PCIe port, ports
   2,3,4,5 are the CPU Eth port (of which only 4 and 5 are actually
   connected to the main CPU's onboard 10G interfaces) and ports 1,6,7
   are for recirculation. All 8 special ports on all other pipes are
   for recirculation.

   The logic below should be reviewed once the proper documentation is
   available.

   Note: recirculation ports are also pipe-specific. Port 68 is the
   recirculation port for pipe #0 on all Tofino1 variants. We mimick
   this by using port #1 on Tofino2.
