/* The Physical port ID of the CPU PCIe port depends on the number of
   pipes (the Tofino ASIC comes in 2- and 4-pipe variants). Note that
   the CPU Eth port can't be used as interface to the control-plane on
   all platforms because it is not always wired to the main board. For
   example, on the WEDGE100BF-65X it is exposed as a port on the front
   panel. On the WEDGE100BF-32X, only two of the lanes are wired to
   the main boards (the others are not connected). Other platforms may
   use different setups. */
